  utter_information_endnote_error:
  - text: "When entering an author in EndNote, the program by default, assumes it is a personal author with first name first, followed by the surname, eg. John Smith. EndNote manipulates this, by inverting the order to Smith, J. In the case of an organisation as author, EndNote will also invert the order by displaying the last word of the organisation first (thinking it is a surname), with the first letters of the rest of the organisation's name as initials, displaying it totally wrong. To fix this, you must make EndNote understand that it is an organisation's name by simply typing a comma (,) after the name of the organisation, eg.: It will then display correct in the reference list in your word document."
