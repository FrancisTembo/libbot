intent: How do I reference secondary sources in a text reference?
utter: A secondary source is, for example, when an author writes about Freud’s view of psychoanalysis without reading Freud’s own work. Making use of the work of other authors like Smith, Jones, or White who wrote about Freud, asks for a secondary citation. It is, however, possible that these authors interpreted Freud incorrectly, causing you to work unscientifically and unethically. Keep secondary citations therefore to the minimum as it is “second-hand” information. If you use the Harvard referencing style click here  https://libguides.nwu.ac.za/harvard-referencing/text-references  (see tab Secondary sources) for more info.

#219✅
intent: I have an organisation as author, but EndNote displays it all wrong in my Word document
utter: When entering an author in EndNote, the program by default, assumes it is a personal author with first name first, followed by the surname, eg. John Smith. EndNote manipulates this, by inverting the order to Smith, J. In the case of an organisation as author, EndNote will also invert the order by displaying the last word of the organisation first (thinking it is a surname), with the first letters of the rest of the organisation's name as initials, displaying it totally wrong. To fix this, you must make EndNote understand that it is an organisation's name by simply typing a comma (,) after the name of the organisation, eg.: It will then display correct in the reference list in your word document.

utter: EndNote is used by millions of researchers, scholarly writers, students, and librarians to search online bibliographic databases, organise references and related files, and create bibliographies instantly.  The software has to be installed on your computer properly in order to work correctly with word processing programs, and this varies depending on your operating system, word processor, and platform. It has frequent upgrades that offer significant new features. Contact our Research librarians for training regarding the use of EndNote.

If special software is needed to open and read an eBook online, the eBook will often provide its own (e.g. eBook Central) software. On Library computers, you can only read the eBook online. Reading eBooks offline Not all of the Library’s eBooks provides this option. If you are not offered a downloading/offline option then it is not available. PDF documents that are not controlled by digital rights management software may be downloaded to most PCs without the need for additional software. Downloading eBooks using Adobe Digital Editions (ADE) software If you wish to download eBooks to your computer or device, you must have both a free Adobe account and the free Adobe Digital Editions (ADE) software installed. Adobe Digital Editions allows you to access eBooks downloaded to your computer in either ePub or PDF format protected with Adobe Digital Rights Management (DRM).   Download Adobe Digital Editions . ​​During the installation of Adobe Digital Editions there should be an option to Authorize Computer. Select Authorize Computer and login with your Adobe ID and Password. Note: If you select Don’t Authorize Computer you cannot transfer an Adobe DRM protected e-Book to another computer or any tablet devices/smartphones and/or eBook readers. In other words, all the purchased or borrowed books afterward belong to that computer. You are able to download or transfer the same eBook to 6 computers and tablet devices/smartphones and eBook readers where either Adobe Digital Editions is installed and authorised with the same Adobe ID.​ Video on how to downloading eBooks available on EbscoHost SpringerLink Tutorial EbooksCentral Tutorial Things to keep in mind about eBooks Not all books are available in eBook format.   Most library eBook collections are presented in formats that are intended for viewing in a browser on a computer.  Due to our licensing agreements with publishers, some eBooks in our collections are limited to one user at a time. Typically eBook files will be in either PDF or ePub format. PDF files don’t adapt well to various sized displays and devices and therefore it is difficult to view some PDF files on small screens that come with some smartphones, tablets and eBook readers.  ePub is the preferred eBook file format as the text reflows to fit the dimensions of the screen. The ePub eBook file format supports Digital Rights Management (DRM).​

intent: What is EDS, and how does it differ from the Library Catalogue?
utter: EDS stands for  EBSCO Discovery Service . EDS provides an easy search platform to users where they can search in almost all the resources that the Library subscribes to in one easy search.  EDS can search inside journals/databases for journal articles. When should I use EDS - To search for articles, eBooks and other content on a given topic.   The Library Catalogue  lists the books, journals and databases the Library ows/subscribes to. Unlike EDS, it cannot search inside the journals/databases for articles. When should I use the Library Catalogue - To determine if the University Libraries has a copy of a specific book, journal or music score.
